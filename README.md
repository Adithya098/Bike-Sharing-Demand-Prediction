# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

This project involves building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict the total number of bikes rented per hour using the bike sharing dataset. The pipeline includes data ingestion, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and model inferencing. The project showcases exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations, comparison of multiple models, and a final model selection based on performance metrics. The solution is documented with a comprehensive README and includes a requirements.txt file for easy environment setup.

## Project Structure

### 1. section_1
- `num2txt.py` : 
  - This is the Python script for the first question.
  - The script is well-commented, explaining the corner test cases handled.

### 2. section_2
#### Ipynb (contains the Jupyter notebooks)
- `EDA.ipynb` : 
  - Notebook where EDA is performed with detailed comments in each cell.
  - Includes inferences derived from each plot, explained under the title "inference".

- `Model.ipynb` :
  - Notebook where the model is built.
  - Contains distinct cells for data pre-processing, modeling, model evaluation, and model inferencing.
  - Includes comments explaining the reasoning behind specific actions and inferences derived from the results (e.g., why certain columns were dropped, why certain models outperform others).

#### Requirements and imports
- `requirement.txt` : Contains all the required libraries to be installed.
- `imports.txt` : Contains all the import statements used in the Model and EDA notebooks.

#### Insights from EDA
- This is a PDF file explaining the insights gained from EDA.
  - Combines results of how various columns affect the 'cnt' column on the first page.
  - Provides user patterns and actionable insights that businesses can work upon.

### 3. Readme.txt
- Comprehensive README file of the entire project.
